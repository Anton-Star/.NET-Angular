    <h1>Accessibility statement for FACT Accreditation Portal</h1>

    <p>We want everyone who visits the FACT Accreditation Portal website to feel welcome and find the experience rewarding.</p>


    <h2>What are we doing?</h2>

    <p>To help us make the FACT Accreditation Portal website a positive place for everyone, we've been using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0</a>. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.</p>

    <p>The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). We’ve chosen Level AAA as the target for the FACT Accreditation Portal website.</p>


    <h2>How are we doing?</h2>

    <p>We're working hard to achieve our goal of Level AAA accessibility, but we realise there are some areas that still need improving. The following information explains what we're doing to make that happen.</p>

    <h3>Success criteria 2.2.1:</h3>

    <p>Due to HIPAA security requirements the application timeout is set at 2 hours.</p>
